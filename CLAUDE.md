## Final Architecture

### ATR-Based Authentication Flow
```
Smart Card → PC/SC → PAM Module → GDM → User Session
     ↓

Card Removal → Lock Service → Session Detection → Screen Lock
```

- **Failure Message** - "Smart card not recognized" for unknown cards
- **Real-time Feedback** - Messages appear immediately on GDM login screen
- **PAM Conversation Integration** - Uses standard PAM messaging system
- **Clean User Experience** - Simple, clear feedback without technical details

### 15. System Cleanup and Optimization
- **Legacy Service Removal** - Completely removed old smartcard-auth service
- **PKCS11 Cleanup** - Removed unused libpam-pkcs11 and configuration
- **Temporary File Cleanup** - Cleared old marker files and directories
- **Package Optimization** - Removed automatically installed unused packages
- **Clean Architecture** - Only essential PAM and lock service components remain

## Advanced Authentication Improvements

### 16. Delayed Authentication Implementation
- **Automatic Card Detection** - PAM module waits 5 seconds for card insertion
- **Visual Feedback** - Shows "Insert smart card..." message while waiting
- **Success Notification** - Displays "Smart card detected" when card found
- **Timeout Handling** - Shows "Card not found" after 5-second timeout
- **Seamless Experience** - No user interaction required, just insert card

### 17. Multi-User Lock Service Enhancement
- **Dynamic User Detection** - Service detects currently active users via loginctl
- **Single User Locking** - Locks only the active user's session, not all configured users
- **Data Structure Optimization** - Changed from map<string,string> to map<string,vector<string>>
- **Duplicate Prevention** - Eliminates duplicate log entries for same card removal
- **Accurate Session Management** - Correctly identifies logged-in user vs configured users

## Deployment Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `sudo apt-get install pcscd libpcsclite-dev libpam0g-dev`
2. Build PAM module: `make -f Makefile-pam && make -f Makefile-pam install-pam`
3. Build lock service: `make -f Makefile-lock && make -f Makefile-lock install-lock`
4. Configure ATR mappings in `/etc/smartcard_login.conf`
5. Install GDM configuration: `sudo cp gdm-password-atr /etc/pam.d/gdm-password`
6. Start services and test authentication

## Final User Experience - v2 (Advanced)
- **Click user (no card)** → **"Insert smart card..."** → Wait 5 seconds for card
- **Insert card within timeout** → **"Smart card detected"** → Automatic passwordless login  
- **No card after timeout** → **"Card not found"** → Falls back to password authentication
- **Remove smart card** → **Immediate screen lock** → Only active user locked
- **Multi-user support** → **Same card works for multiple accounts** → Dynamic user detection
- **Clean experience** → **Seamless, automatic** → No manual interaction required
